This is a web based chatbot developed using flask api(python). We use a special artificial neural network (ANN) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.The model is trained using backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization,the model is working quite well with an accuracy of 85.09%.
